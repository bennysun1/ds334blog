    "text": "In my second blog post, I will be analyzing a data set of countries’ C02 emissions. I acquired this data from Kaggle which the user sourced from https://data.worldbank.org/ in 2018. The data set includes 266 observations (countries and regions), as well as each location’s metric tons of C02 emissions per capita for years between 1960-2018. This metric indicates a country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in relation to its population size. Meaning, it quantifies the amount of CO2 emissions produced by a country per person, which provides insight into the individual carbon footprints and overall environmental sustainability for a given region. I seek to visualize which countries in recent history have had the largest changes in CO2 emission per capita. It is important to note there are groups and regions which are used in this data set (e.g. Post-demographic dividend, Upper middle income, Europe & Central Asia, etc) which I exclude from some of my later analysis, because the data set does not outline which countries fall into these groups and regions."

I chose to view these years, because starting around 1990 the evidence and risks of human-caused warming first became widely known. It can be seen from the map, countries like Estonia, the UAE, and Luxembourg have higher metric tons of emissions per capita. This makes sense, because these countries are either relatively smaller in population or known for their oil production. When looking at some of the larger land-mass countries, it can be seen the USA and Russia seem to have decreased their emissions per capita over these years. On the contrary, countries like China, Saudi Arabai, and Kazakhstan have increased over the same period.\n\n\nemissions_longer %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 2000) %&gt;%\n  filter(country %in% largest_inc #| country %in% largest_dec\n         ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year,\n             y = metric_tons_pcapita,\n             group = country,\n             color = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~country) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 6),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title= \"Countries with Largest Percent Increase in\\nMetric Tons of CO2 Per Capital from 2000 to 2018\",\n       y = \"Metric Tons of CO2 Per Capita\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       color = \"Country\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Map above gives an interesting global view of emission changes throughout the years, it is more difficult to see the changes in emissions from smaller countries. I compare some of the emissions of countries with top percent increases in metric tons of CO2 per capita from the year 2000 to 2018. From this plot it can be seen Laos increased their CO2 emissions per capita drastically by nearly 2.5 metric tons over the the 18 year period which translated to a 14.74% increase. Vietnam also had a large emission increases over this period of just under 2.5 metric tons.\n\n\nemissions_longer %&gt;%\n  filter(year &gt;= 2000) %&gt;%\n  filter(country %in% largest_dec) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year,\n             y = metric_tons_pcapita,\n             group = country,\n             color = country)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~country) +\n\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title= \"Countries with Largest Percent Decrease in\\nMetric Tons of CO2 Per Capital from 2000 to 2018\",\n       y = \"Metric Tons of CO2 Per Capita\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       color = \"Country\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, I compare some of the emissions of countries with top percent decreases in metric tons of CO2 per capita from the year 2000 to 2018. From this plot it can be seen Denmark decreased their CO2 emissions per capita drastically over the the 18 year period by over 3 metric tons, translating to a 41.64% decrease. Korea had the largest percent decrease in emissions at 77.36% from a roughly 2 metric ton decrease in C02 emission per capita."

This would allow the reader to see both the change in raw metrics tons in addition to the percent change. In the future, I would like to also join together population data to compare how dependent these per capita metrics are based on each countries’ population. I would also love to acquire the lists of countries which belong to the groups and regions I excluded from my analysis to identify geographical trends in global emissions."

    "text": "Connections to Class Ideas\nIn my first map plot, I implemented a Mercator projection of the globe and colored each country by its metric tons of CO2 emissions per capita. This map served as an effective visualization, because it allowed me to observe the fact that countries with smaller land-mass (and most likely population) often had higher CO2 emissions per capita. Without this, my hypothesis about population would potentially have overlooked. My next plots utilized line graphs and facet wrapping of the top percentage changes in CO2 emissions per capita. Doing this allowed me to present this 18 year time series data in a fashion where is was uncluttered and easy to interpret."

Each team is grouped into a faceted section of the plot according to their division. The standard error is plotted in addition to the mean batting average for each team to display the variability and confidence intervals around the averages. It can be seen the Colorado Rockies are predicted to have highest average batting average in the 2024 season. Most teams have consistent standard errors, but it appears the Milwaukee Brewers have the smallest standard error, indicating their players are likely to have batting averages closer to their mean batting average than other teams.\n\n\n# bar plot mean OPS\nteam_avg_projections %&gt;%\n  mutate(Team = fct_reorder(Team, avg_ops), .desc = T) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Team,\n             y = avg_ops,\n             fill = Division)) +\n  geom_col(color = 'black') +\n  labs(y = 'Mean OPS',\n       title = 'Mean OPS by Team') +\n  scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 6) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.position = 'none') +\n  facet_wrap(~ Division, scales = 'free_y') +\n  #coord_flip(ylim = c(0.22,0.26)) +\n  coord_flip(ylim = c(0.6,0.75)) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second plot examines each team’s mean on base percentage plus slugging percentage (OPS) using bar plots faceted by their Division. This statistic is unique because it gives insight into the likelihood of a team getting on base and generating extra base hits. Again it can be the Colorado Rockies are projected to have the highest OPS in the MLB at over 0.720. Just behind are both the Boston Red Sox and the Atlanta Braves."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBecause there are 30 teams in the MLB, I decided to facet the teams by their division to make the plots seem less cluttered. In the first plot I also utilized the error bar for displaying the standard error as presented in class. This gives us more information about the distribution of batting averages for each team, which would be lost in the summarized data. To make both graphs easily interpretable, I also arranged each faceted plot to be sorted in descending order of the statistic being examined. This makes it easy for the viewer to see which team has the highest and lowest statistics in each division. In this data set it’s important to note there were 89 players who had ‘NA’ values for their ‘Team’ variable. This is due to the fact that these players are free agents in 2024, so they are currently unassigned to a team. For simplicity, I removed these players from my analysis so I could compare teams and their current players. In the future, I would be interested in comparing each player’s and team’s projected statistics against their actual 2024 statistics. A huge amount is bet on fantasy sports, so it would be interesting to see how well these projections perform."
